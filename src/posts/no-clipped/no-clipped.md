## Introduction

Looking forward to help my brother with his project, and willing to develop my skills on the Angular environment, I decided to learn this framework making an online clothing store.

## The project

The project is an online store to display a grid of clothing products, with a quick view option and a Cart section to buy them. Is going to count with an "About us" section. It will start getting random data from the internet until the actual products database is constructed. User may log in and track their purchases, with a simple JWT authentication system.

## Technologies

It uses Angular as a framework, strongly typed with TypeScript, and styled with SCSS. Backend handled by NodeJS, and currently using Forms and Http modules from AngularCLI. Is not deployed yet, but willing to in a week or so.
