## Introduction

This space was created to show my projects and my blog posts. I wanted to create a space where I could show myself as a developer.

## The Project

The project was a simple blog/portfolio that allowed the user to see my projects and my blog posts. The posts will be created around markdown syntax and storage in the same repo. The markdown accepts code snippets and images. Also I wanted to add an "About" and "Contact" section, and links to my social media.

### The Technologies

The project was created using Svelte and Svelte kit. I used OpenProps for the styling and my own svgs to make it more mine. Posts are locally stored and used through an API request. The "Contact" form is connected to a Supabase project to store the messages with the emails. Git and Github were used for version control and deployment. Currently deployed in Vercel and built with Svelte Vercel Adapter.
