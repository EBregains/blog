## Introduction

This is the first project I worked on. It was a simple to-do list that I made to learn about React and their hooks, DOM manipulation and project structures. I also learned about the importance of planning and how to structure a project.

## The Project

The project was a simple to-do list that allowed the user to add, remove and mark tasks as completed. It also had a search bar that allowed the user to filter the tasks by name.

## The Process

The first step was to plan the project. I started by creating a wireframe of the project and writing down the features I wanted to implement. I also created a list of the technologies I wanted to use and the libraries I wanted to include.

After planning the project, I started working on the design. I used Figma to create the design and then implemented it using HTML and CSS. I also used JavaScript to add functionality to the design.

After completing the design, I started working on the functionality. I used React to create the components and then used JavaScript to add functionality to the components.
