# Personal Blog / Semi-Portfolio

This is my personal blog, which I use to write about things I find interesting. It's also a semi-portfolio, where I showcase some of my projects.

## Tecnologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with OpenProps)
- TypeScript

Deployed on Vercel, the site is prerender and amazingly fast! It has theme switcher to go dark and light.
